            Today, was a very eventful and fun day. At  first I thougt it was just a regular school day, but later on in the day I found out we were going to watch a movie! I also managed to show off my Cheif Scout Silver Award, which is the highest award possible in Cub Scouts. Afterward... guess what? HOMEWORK. After dinner I went out to Paisley CoderDojo were this blog coding had begun. (by the way, there is a link to the Paisley CoderDojo website below! :-) )

            A regular day, a regular routine, day 2 of the blog. Did you know that I have the most annoying sisters in the world? They tell on me for the littlest of things, all day, every day. they're called Willow and Lottie. When I got to school I told everyone I could about my blog, but after Maths and English, I failed to show her my blog. It's pancake day today, but there have been no pankaces so far but I hope I get at least one pancake today or the defenition of pancake day is destroyed. When I got home, boy was I relieved when I heard we were having pancakes for dinner. I had cheese and tuna in mine and my sisters had cheese. Later, when I went to the bathroom I stood on something WET. I seriously hope it wasn't wiz, or it might turn out to be awkward and very gross. I don't know if I told you this, but I'm obsessed with science, and sometimes I wish I could get my physics decree early. So that is what I read before bed, but I'm only a 10 year old boy. Then finally I felt relieved because the day was over and I could finally stretch my legs. Before I actually manage to get to sleep, I like to plan my dream in my head. I often come up with the most weird and whacky ideas, what can you formulate in YOUR mind?

              YAY! Wednesday! My favourite day of the week! Today I was doing some work on my new topic: The Rainforest. I do quite like the topic, mostly because I like Biology, and there's a lot of it in the topic. Also a bit of artwork here and there, and that is what I did on the topic today, a bit of poetry telling people facts on The Rainforest. After school I got picked up by my gran and aunt, which came as a surprise to me, because I don't often do this. We went out to eat at the Linwood Farm, and I ordered the carvery, so did my gran. We ordered, for desert, a slice of fudge cake, it was HUGE! I never finished it, because as I said, it was HUGE! Afterward I had to go home and get changed for Cub Scouts, which is why I like Wednesdays so much. At Cubs I'll be outside instead of in the hall, because it's Ash Wednesday, and the church will be using it. Oh well, there has been a mistake, we're meant to be outdoors, but now we're indoors. I got to choose and host a game: Trench Warfare. After the games, before we were dismissed, I got another badge: The U Shape badge. Unfortunately, I'll only get to keep it for a year! But I had to get home, get to bed, and get to sleep.

              The most regular day of the week; Thursday. I hate Thursdays. Today I was practicing for a performace called: I Wish. It puts so much pressure on me to do good. In addition to that, I don't always remember my lines. The performance will be 2 or 3 weeks from now, but although that sounds like a lot of time to practice, but it isn't a lot to me. When school was out, I got picked up by my grandparents today, same as yesterday. But this time they were on my Dad's side of the family, and I really like them because, they're fun and make me laugh. But before you start judging me, and saying that's favouritism, because it isn't, although that may be what you think. So I went there and did my homework, got it cheked and signed. Afterward I went home and had dinner. A pancake with ham and cheese, and my sisters: just cheese. I had 2 of them. Afterward my mum came home after what looks like a very long shopping trip to somewhere, and I saw 2 boxes of 1 of my favourite cereal types. After dinner came dessert; another pancake but this time with CHOCOLATE. Everybody likes CHOCOLATE! (Well most people anyway)! Finally, it was time for bed, but I decided to read for a bit beforehand, but eventually it's time to call it a day.

              FRIDAY!!! YAY!!! It's MOVIE NIGHT TONIGHT!!! But otherwise a regular, ordinary school day today. The day started off with Maths. Then English. Then a little more school-work. Maths started out being about mental addition reinforcement, to laptop gaming, which made maths pretty fun today. Next up: English! This time, not as fun. All we did was a stupid spelling test, and these stupid storyboards. In addition to that, we were announced we had to prepare a big solo talk about a chosen topic. I think I might do mine on my coding habbit, but I'm not quite sure yet about what I'm going to do for it. Later, a little more on the Rainforest topic, mostly drawing, painting and researching. I never actually managed to do any research, because I was drawing and painting. When school was out, Willow's friend, Sophie, came home for a playdate today. We had pizza for dinner and I watched Star Wars; The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. I managed to get Maltesers and nobody knew about it. I even dressed up as Darth Vader! Unfortunately for me, Lottie ripped it trying to get her own way. YAAWWWNN, time for bed Harris, That's a days success for me!

              Saturday, nice day. This morning, I went to IKEA for breakfast and I had one of the most delicious sausage rolls I've ever tasted. I brought a book called: Help Your Kids With Science. It is my cousin Scot's birthday on Wednesday, so we went out shopping to get him a present today. I hate shopping and I was seriously thinking of ways to entertain myself. First me and my Dad went to Next, whilst my Mum and sisters went to M&S. We went shopping for about half an hour at those shops.

              Another Monday today, although I don't generally like Mondays but today was actually surprisingly fun for a change. Today I did maths as usual but I managed to get out of doing it because I do a during class club that I signed up for. The club was music related and it was learning how to play the Cello. Yep, English next, my least favourite subject. All we did was assign our next homework task, and do this stupid worksheet on the book that we're currently reading. The actual book we're reading I quite like, whereas the worksheets are a little annoying. Lunch in class today I had my favourite sandwich filling: tuna. I also had juice instead of water, also I got to pick where I sat. It was probably my favourite school day ever. Yep after lunch, more on the rainforest. It was more artwork and I've got to say, I'm quite proud of how it turned out. When I got home just a little homework. After homework I got Roblox and I didn't stop until it was time to go to CoderDojo. When I got there I started coding right away. I was coding this blog when I had to go. When I got home I read for a bit before I got to sleep. Time to call it a day.
